# RAM tester
This program is meant to be burned to a cartridge ROM and run on a Soggy-1000 clone system. It runs a few simple tests, first doing a check for mirroring to establish the total amount of RAM installed into the system, and then performs a test of the Soggy's page switching functionality. It is not exhaustive nor necessarily indicative of hardware faults.
