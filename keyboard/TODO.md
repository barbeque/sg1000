- [ ] convert to kicad 6 somehow so it's consistent
- [ ] rewire the entire matrix, the generated one is wrong
- [ ] wire the 8255
- [ ] change footprint to a dip atmega because why not
- [ ] have a footprint to program the dip atmega (note that the icsp header may be non-standard as provided: https://github.com/jeroen94704/klepcbgen/issues/13)
- [ ] [pc6601] add 4p4c header
- [ ] add proto area
- [x] add sega header (use a keyed internal SCSI connector)
- [ ] [pc6601] add ir led and resistor and transistor?
- [ ] add mounting holes for eventual enclosure, feet for now
- [x] re-do the layout again now that the keys have changed - shift is 2.25u for instance
- [ ] find a shrouded connector with a key pin for the sega connector
