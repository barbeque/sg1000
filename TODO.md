- [x] export SN76489 symbol from leako, and import it into here and the global lib storage
- [x] add the address, I/O decoders
- [x] check the write pin on the RAM
- [x] add the TMS9918
- [x] ...and the DRAM-SRAM intercept flipflops
- [x] make a symbol for the cart slot
- [x] make a footprint for the cart slot part
- [x] will the power transistor setup from leako work?
- [x] populate all the z80 pins with labels
- [x] double check NMI transistor pinout, use a PNP i already stock (3906?)
- [x] copy digikey pn from leako for 6mm push button
- [x] what size of resistor should i use? looks like i started out with 0805 again for capacitors, i guess we're doing 0805 again here
- [ ] confirm the weirdness with /WR or WR for /WE on 76489
- [x] finish switching to the cypress THT 62256 since i already have some?
- [x] copy video and audio output circuits from leako
- [x] double check the decoder weave for the controllers
- [x] find 74ls257
- [x] usb power input (with power flags)
- [x] power switch
- [x] add a spare footprint for an emergency inverter
- [x] cart slot is actually 0.125"
- [x] print and check cartridge interference once parts arranged
- [x] stuff all this into a board and route it
- [x] keyboard port? what's it even look like
- [ ] maybe do the flange and mounting holes on the cart slot after all
- [X] make a decision on 150x150 - it's only 78 cents more per board and i don't think anyone cares
- [x] make room for mounting holes
- [x] either find a new cartridge slot or make sure parts aren't hitting the mounting holes - YES - EDAC 396-044-520-201
