- [x] export SN76489 symbol from leako, and import it into here and the global lib storage
- [x] add the address, I/O decoders
- [x] check the write pin on the RAM
- [ ] add the TMS9918 and the DRAM-SRAM intercept flipflops
- [ ] make a symbol for the cart slot
- [ ] make a footprint for the cart slot part
- [ ] will the power transistor setup from leako work?
- [x] populate all the z80 pins with labels
- [x] double check NMI transistor pinout, use a PNP i already stock (3906?)
- [x] copy digikey pn from leako for 6mm push button
- [ ] what size of resistor should i use? looks like i started out with 0805 again for capacitors
- [ ] confirm the weirdness with /WR or WR for /WE on 76489
- [x] finish switching to the cypress THT 62256 since i already have some?
